# Cracking the Technical Interview    

## Framing: 

Are you dreading the technical interview?  Not sure what to expect or how to calm your nerves? Don’t worry as we will help you prepare to nail the interview and wow the employer!

## Learning Objectives & Themes: 

This workshop will help prepare students for the dreaded technical interview. Students will experience first hand what it’s like to be in a technical interview setting and get tips on how to prepare. Students will get to practice this difficult experience in a workshop setting. Facilitator will go over general questions, what to do or say when you don’t know the answer, and examples of interview scenarios. 

**Themes:** Understanding the Landscape

## Best Practices: 
Employers want to know how you think. Be prepared to talk out loud.  How did you go from a blank slate to a finished product? Use your projects as a guide. 

**1. Before the Technical Challenge**

*Do’s*
- Prepare pen, paper and earphones/headphones.
- Find a quiet environment with good Internet connection.
- Ensure webcam and audio are working. 
- Decide on and be familiar with a programming language.
- Familiarize yourself with the coding environment (CoderPad/CodePen). Set up the coding shortcuts, turn on autocompletion, tab spacing, etc.
- Prepare answers to the frequently-asked questions in an interview.
- Prepare some questions to ask at the end of the interview.
- Dress comfortably. 
Stay calm and composed.

**2. Introduction**

*Do’s*
- Introduce yourself in a few sentences under a minute or two.
- Mention interesting points that are relevant to the role you are applying for.
- Sound enthusiastic! Speak with a smile and you will naturally sound more engaging.

*Don’ts*
- Spend too long introducing yourself. The more time you spend talking the less time you have to show your skills.

**3. Upon Getting the Question**

*Do’s*
- Repeat the question back at the interviewer.
- Clarify any assumptions you made subconsciously. Many questions are under-specified on purpose. A tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work.
- Clarify input format and range. Ask whether input can be assumed to be well-formed and non-null.
- Work through a small example to ensure you understood the question.
- Explain a high level approach even if it is a brute force one.
- Improve upon the approach and optimize. Reduce duplicated work and cache repeated computations.
- Think carefully, then state and explain the time and space complexity of your approaches.
- If stuck, think about related problems you’ve seen before and how they were solved. Check out the tips in this section.

*Don’ts*
- Ignore information given to you. Every piece is important.
- Jump into coding/designing straightaway.
- Start challenge  without interviewer’s green light.
- Appear too unsure about your approach or analysis.

**4. During the Technical Challenge** 

*Do’s*
- Explain what you are coding/typing to the interviewer, what you are trying to achieve.
- Practice good coding style. Clear variable names, consistent operator spacing, proper indentation, etc.
- Type/write at a reasonable speed.
- As much as possible, write actual compilable code, not pseudocode.
- Write in a modular fashion. Extract out chunks of repeated code into functions.
- Ask for permission to use trivial functions without having to implement them; saves you some time.
- Use the hints given by the interviewer.
- Demonstrate mastery of your chosen programming language.
- Demonstrate technical knowledge in data structures and algorithms.
- If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints). E.g., I would write a regex to parse this string rather than using split()which may not cover all cases.
- Practice whiteboard space-management skills.
- Reasonable defensive coding. Check for nulls, empty collections, etc. Can omit if input validity has been clarified with the interviewer.

*Don’ts*
- Remain quiet the whole time.
- Spend too much time writing comments.
- Use extremely verbose variable names.
- Copy and paste code without checking.
- Interrupt your interviewer when they are talking. Usually if they speak, they are trying to give you hints or steer you in the right direction.
- Write too big (takes up too much space) or too small (illegible) if on a whiteboard.

**5. After the Technical Challenge**

*Do’s*
- Scan through your code for mistakes as if it was your first time seeing code written by someone else.
- Check for off-by-one errors.
- Come up with more test cases. Try extreme test cases.
- Step through your code with those test cases.
- Look out for places where you can refactor.
- Reiterate the time and space complexity of your code.
- Explain trade-offs and how the code/approach can be improved if given more time.

*Don’ts*
- Immediately announce that you are done coding. Do the above first!
- Argue with the interviewer. They may be wrong but that is very unlikely given that they are familiar with the question.

**6. Wrap Up**

*Do’s*
- Ask questions. More importantly, ask good and engaging questions that are tailored to the company! Pick some questions from this list.
- Thank the interviewer.

*Don’ts*
- End the interview without asking any questions.
- Ask about your interview performance. It can get awkward.

## Homework: 
Homework due Sunday at 7pm:
- **GA Profile** - Complete your [GA Profile](https://profiles.generalassemb.ly/profiles/new) & submit for review through the profile system.
  - Review the [GA Profile Resource Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xdfwDtk_2ds5NaPzQxxlcPa0tjvTa52WNrOAPeqTtdE/edit?usp=sharing) for Q&A and tips. 
- Interview Prep - Continue to prepare and practice for interviews including more technical interview prep using the resources below. 
  - Keep practicing your answers to common interview questions using the [Interview Question Generator](https://www.interviewquestiongenerator.com/en-US/).
- Catch Up - Be working on any remaining job seeker toolkit items that have not be completed. Late work will no longer be accepted, but you will need each piece in your toolkit for your job search. 
- Start Applying - Start applying for jobs and track them in your personal job tracker! Aim for at least 3 - 4 applications before graduation. Reach out for any help you need customizing your application materials.
