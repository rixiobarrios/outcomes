## What happens after graduation?
Congrats, you graduated from GAâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive Program! We are so proud of all of your hard work and you should be too. We know that you may have a few additions to your resume and portfolio, or may want some additional practice to work on your pitch - we got you covered!  You will work closely with your coach to discover how to best sell your talents to employers and set yourself up for success in your job search. Here are some things to be aware of going forward. 

## Final Outcomes Toolkit Materials 
**You MUST have all of your job search materials 100% done by the Monday following graduation - 11/25/19.** 
We expect your Resume, Cover Letter, LinkedIn, GA Profile, and Portfolio to be final at this point. By this we mean you would be ok if an employer saw any of these materials. Remember that these materials are required to receive ongoing support from Outcomes.

## Outcomes Bootcamp
There will be a mandatory Outcomes Bootcamp post course for anyone that will be participating in the Outcomes program. We'll discuss how to tackle life after GA (goal setting, time management, job search review, etc.).

## Monday Check Ins
Each Monday, you'll receive an email with the subject line: #MotivationMonday - DATE. This email will contain helpful articles, recent job posting, words of wisdom and a reminder link to complete the Monday check in survey. Every job seeker is expected to complete the check in survey each week.

## Job Seeker Standups
Job Seeker Standup calls will be Mondays for a minimum of 4 weeks post-course. Job Seekers are encouraged to join the call as a way to connect with each other and have dedicated access to their Coach. We'll discuss what's happening in the job search, areas people are struggling, do interview practice and portfolio presentations, and anything else folks want to talk about. These calls are for job seekers so we'll talk about whatever is top of mind for you! 

## Monthly Post-Course Webinars
Join us for a monthly post-course programming offering that helps job seekers level up their skills and pursue the work they love. This is a unified post-course initiative that is intended to help job seekers level up their skills and drive Outcomes results. This initiative emphasizes the GA Outcomes experience and focuses on content that is intended to lead to getting jobs faster.

We are proud to involve the entire GA Outcomes Career Coach Team to provide a well rounded experience, offer job seekers with a variety of perspectives, and motivate grads with relevant content they can use to drive success.

When: These sessions will be offered on the third Friday of every month from 3-4pm EST (2-3pm CST, 1-2pm MST, 12-1pm PST).

These sessions are held via Zoom in the weinbar format, which means you won't be on camera or able to come off mute. So you can listen and reply/comment via chat. These sessions are free and attendance is strongly encouraged. Your Coach will send info about these prior to each month's session.

## Keep in Contact with Your Coach
Remember, that your Coach is here to support you each step of the way.  The best thing you can do is to keep them in the loop and let them know what is going on. They will review what it means to be a strategic job seeker, the requirements for maintaining Outcomes support, and what to expect in the upcoming months. In the meantime, don't hesitate to schedule time with your coach for specific needs.
