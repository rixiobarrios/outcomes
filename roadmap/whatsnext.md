# Hiring Managers AMA Panel + Post-Course Expectations

## Framing:
We'll start the session hearing from hiring managers who work for organizations across the US. This panel will help students understand what hiring managers are looking for in the field. The discussion will give an overview of the current hiring landscape as well as tips and tricks to landing the interview.

This is where the rubber hits the road. Ready for the transition into the big working world?  No?  Thatâ€™s ok! We are still here to support you and your job search!  Let's talk about how to keep the Job Search actions going and ways to be supported!

## Learning Objectives & Themes:
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
- identify what will be expected of them post-course and how that plays into their job search success
- recall advice shared by hiring managers on how they can best stand out in the interview process

**Themes:** All of them! 

## Final Material Expectations:
We expect your Resume, Cover Letter, LinkedIn, and GA Profile to be final at this point, but understand if you are still working on adding your final project and portfolio. Remember that your portfolio must be complete within one week of graduation to receive support from Outcomes.
