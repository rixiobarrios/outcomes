# Developing Your Brand Statement 

## Framing:
Your brand is your value proposition. It is important to understand who you are as a professional in your chosen field. It is what makes you uniquely qualified over candidates who are just merely qualified based solely on hard skills.

But how do you promote your brand and talents? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered!  We will show you how to explain yourself and your talents in a compelling and interesting way so that your brand doesn’t get lost in translation.

This will help you to establish your pitch when you are at networking events or interviewing.

**Themes:** Developing Your Brand

## Crafting Your Brand Statement: 
We know this is tough! Remember that this is just a starting point. 

## Here's the step by step process to help you write your draft. 

**Step 1: Identify your top 5 themes** 
  - Look at the notes from the branding workshop, your personality test results, and your professional brand story. What are the recurring themes? What are the ones that you have done consistently and effectively throughout your career and life and that you can defend with examples? (Examples: Leader, team-player, kind, generous, influencer, visionary, calm). 
  
**Step 2: What's the benefit to these themes?** 
- For example: The benefit of being a visionary could be that you inspire a team to move forward. The benefit of being a problem solver is that you don't stop until every hurdle is overcome. List as many benefits as you can think for each of your themes. 
  
**Step 3: Build a statement that strings these benefits together concisely, powerfully and effectively.** 
- Practice and wordsmith your statement to communicate your most authentic self that tells your story, highlights your strengths, and embodies who you are as a person and professional. This is going to be challenging! If you get stuck, we recommend creating lots of different versions.
