# Resume Best Practices

## Framing: 

We know that you likely don’t know yet what you want to do or where to even begin with your resume; that’s okay! Our goal today is to show you what success looks like, and to get your content into a draft that you can continue to work on throughout the course.

## Learning Objectives:
This week, we will help you build a winning resume that gets noticed. You’ll learn how to create your resume that tells a story and highlights your relevant past experience and integrates your new web development skills. By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- identify the characteristics of an impactful resume.
- apply best practice to write an impactful resume.
- evaluate their resumes.

**Themes:** Designing Your Job Search; Developing Your Brand; Understanding the Landscape 

## Homework: 
Homework due Sunday at 7pm:
- **Resume Draft** - Use the resume reflections and self-assessment that you noted to revise your resume. Use the [Resume Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXVPjnKK0FkUPHJrxlEfGIVlZ4W0ponfYFjR2jViXf4/edit?usp=sharing) and [Resume Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AHYLTZmmp8Xprfep3jcmNi73epYDKG2Rt_XTA6e9hLA/edit?usp=sharing) for support.
