# Meeting One-on-One with Your Outcomes Coach

I LOVE meeting and talking with you, please don't be shy! 

1:1s are a safe space to talk about anything job search or career related. 1:1s might include:
- Your previous work history 
- Goals for your future 
- Creating your job search strategy 
- Job search barriers or constraints (I LOVE designing around constraints ;)
- Getting you past roadblocks 
- Follow up or networking strategies 
- Feedback on your materials 

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the 1:1s, so please come with questions prepared and be on time! I understand things come up. If you need to cancel your 1:1, please do so at least 24 hours (1 day) in advance so another student has access to that time. 

Also, please do not sign up for times during your class/lab time as you will not be excused to leave class to meet with me. Find times during your lunch hour or after class. If there are not slots available and you would really like to meet, please message me directly and we'll work something out.
